## About

This writing sample is a <em>Security Configuration Guide</em> for a web-based monitoring application for backup and recovery operations in a data center. 

This guide was written for one of the products I was responsible during my time as a Technical Content Developer II at Dell EMC. This project was one of my most challenging assignments, one of which I am particularly proud of. It required a lot of research to understand LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and many discussions with engineering to complete this guide.
