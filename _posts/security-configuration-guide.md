## About

Dell EMC Data Protection Central (DPC) is a web-based monitoring application where IT administrators can view dashboards and KPIs to monitor backup and recovery operations in their data center. This writing sample is the <em>Data Protection Central 18.2 Security Configuration Guide</em>. 

DPC was one of the products I was responsible during my time as a Technical Content Developer II at Dell EMC. This project was one of my most challenging assignments, one of which I am particularly proud of. It required a lot of research to understand LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and a many discussions with engineering.
