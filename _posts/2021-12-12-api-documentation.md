## About

This writing sample is an <em>API Reference</em> guide for API integrations of the software I work on at Veeva Systems. I tested each part of the API as part of developing this guide to verify the instructions and gather the API request and response samples. 

## API Help Link

I wrote the **Safety** section of the API Reference on the following webpage:

<a href="https://developer.veevavault.com/api/22.1/#safety" target="_blank" class="button button--large">See This Sample <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>

## Audience

Developers are the target audience for this guide.
