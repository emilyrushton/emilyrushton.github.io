## About

This sample is an <em>HTML5 Animation</em>, illustrating the steps that occur during AS2 communication between two trading partners. AS2 is a secure electronic data transmission protocol between two trading partners (gateways) through the Internet. I prepared this animation for the software I work on at Veeva Systems.
