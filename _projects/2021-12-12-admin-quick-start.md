## About

This writing sample is a <em>Quick Start Guide</em> for administrators getting started with the software I work on at Veeva Systems. 

I designed this article with interactive accordions to allow readers to expand/hide the content they need while skipping topics they don't as they set up the system. All of the content on this page is single-sourced from larger admin articles on each topic, which are linked to in the <em>Read More</em> links. 

Originally published in 2019, this guide remains of the most frequently accessed pages on the online help site.

## Help Link
