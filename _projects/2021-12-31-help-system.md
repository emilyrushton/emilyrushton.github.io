## About

I independently built this <em>Online Help System</em> during my role at Veeva Systems. This project required me to learn front-end web development, git, and how static site generators work while also developing the help content for a new product. I originally built this system in 2019 and it has evolved over the years with various improvements as I've become more comfortable with Javascript and web design. 

## Help Link

See the help system at the following link:

## Audience

The help system contains content for a variety of users with a variety of roles, including administrators.
